Research parameter optimization with neural network

u:  
u0: 
r:  ramp up, acceleration to target setpoint, speeds up or slows down the transient, maximum slope for acceleration
r0: controller parameter, is equal to r
h:	sampling period
h0: controller parameter, is equal to h
h1: precision coefficient, typically a 4x multiple of h
v1: desired target
v2: derivative of the target
z1: 
z2: 
z3: 
b:  
b0: 
d:  h * r^2, time period * the maximum acceleration that can be used squard
y:  the input from the sensor, process variable = pv = y
v:  setpoint or target
